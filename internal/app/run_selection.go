// Choosing what a run acts on: options from a Request or from argv, and the
// rules both must obey.
//
// This mirrors resume_selection.go deliberately. Resume has had a shared
// validResumeOptions since the seam was introduced; run did not, and the
// difference was a live §21.1 violation rather than a stylistic one. The
// derivation below lived only in runArguments - an argv parser - so
// `dmtx run --config m.yaml` recorded into m.yaml.state.db while the same
// command through the API recorded into nothing at all.

// runUsage and resumeUsage are each one string, so the flags an operator is
// offered cannot drift from the flags the parser accepts without both changing
// in the same edit. Both were duplicated across two files before this - the
// parser's copy and the executor's - which is two places to update and one to
// forget.
//
// The --state example is a .yaml deliberately, though the derived default is
// .state.db. state.NewBackend selects the YAML store for .yaml and .yml and
// SQLite for everything else, so the example shows the thing --state is for:
// naming a state file the default would not have produced. An example matching
// the default would demonstrate only what happens without the flag.
