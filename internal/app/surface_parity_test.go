// operator asking the console what dmtx could do got a different answer from
// the one the terminal gave, which is exactly what §21.1 forbids.
//
// It went unnoticed because the parity test that existed compared Execute
// against the API - both sides of the same function - over a hand-written list
// of four commands that happened to be the implemented ones. This iterates
// contract.Commands, so a command added to the registry is covered the day it
// is added rather than the day someone remembers to list it.

// runEveryCommandSomewhereDisposable isolates a test from the real machine.

// These tests invoke every registered command, and not every command is a

//
//   - init writes a configuration relative to the working directory, so
//     enumerating commands from the package directory left a migration.yaml in
//     the source tree. That reached a commit.
//   - init-secrets writes to ~/.secrets, which the working directory does not
//     govern at all. That reached the author's actual home directory, alongside
//     their real credentials for two other tools.
//
// The second is the lesson: redirecting the working directory looked like
// isolation and was not, because the next command derived its path from
// somewhere else entirely. A test that enumerates commands has to assume the
// next one added will reach somewhere new, so both the directory and the home
// are moved rather than only the one that has bitten so far.
//
