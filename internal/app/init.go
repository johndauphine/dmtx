// definition someone who has not written one before.

// Two deliberate choices, neither of them a default. The endpoints are
// sqlite-to-sqlite because that is the one pair somebody can try without
// provisioning a server first; dmtx's own defaults for a missing type are
// mssql and postgres, which are no use to someone finding out what this does.
// The tuning settings are left commented out because dmtx derives them, and a
// starter file that pinned them would override the very thing analyze exists
// to explain.
//
// The password is left empty deliberately. Writing a placeholder invites it
// being kept, and a file created by a tool is a file people trust.
