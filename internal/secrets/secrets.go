// Package secrets owns the file dmtx keeps material in that must not sit in a
// migration configuration.
//
// It is at ~/.secrets/dmtx/config.yaml. The ~/.secrets convention comes from
// DMT, so an operator moving between the tools finds it where they expect and
// their backup exclusions carry over; the per-tool subdirectory does not,
// because that convention predates several tools sharing the directory.
//
// Partitioning is what makes the protections enforceable. dmtx owns
// ~/.secrets/dmtx and can tighten it; it cannot tighten ~/.secrets without
// changing permissions on other tools' files. The rule throughout is: enforce
// what dmtx owns, report what it does not.
//
// It does mean dmtx keeps its own files in two places, since the serve state
// file lives in the platform config directory; the familiarity was judged worth
// the split.
//
// What this protects, and what it does not: owner-only Unix modes or a
// protected current-account Windows ACL, plus refusal to load a looser file,
// keep other accounts on the machine out. They do not protect against somebody
// holding the disk - that is full-disk encryption's job. The distinction
// matters because a store that implied more would invite putting things in it
// that deserve better.
