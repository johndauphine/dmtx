// Turning a typed line into a Request.
//
// The console has words where the command line has argv. Everything after the
// splitting is app.ParseRequest, so the flag rules exist once; the splitting
// itself is here because the command line never does it - a shell did that
// before dmtx was started.

// errUnterminatedQuote is returned for a line whose quote never closes.
var errUnterminatedQuote = errors.New("unterminated quote")

// errMultipleLines is returned for input holding more than one line.
var errMultipleLines = errors.New("input holds more than one line")

// splitLine breaks a typed line into arguments.
//
// This is deliberately not a shell. Spaces and tabs separate, single and double
// quotes group, and a backslash inside a double-quoted span escapes the next
// character. There is no variable expansion, no globbing, no command
// substitution, no operators - a line is a command and its flags, nothing that
// reaches back out into the machine.
//
// Only spaces and tabs, and only ASCII ones. A non-breaking space arrives by
// pasting from a web page rather than by being typed, and splitting on it would
// break a path that an operator can see is one path. Quoting protects it either
// way.
//
// Newlines are the other half of that. An *embedded* one is refused rather than
// treated as a separator: two pasted lines joined into one would silently
// produce a different command than either, since "status" and "--state m.db"
// pasted together tokenise into a perfectly valid status the operator never
// typed. The same reasoning as decodeRequest refusing a body with two JSON
// documents - a caller must not be able to believe it asked for something that
// never happened.
//
// Leading and trailing whitespace, newlines included, is trimmed rather than
// refused. That is what a paste or a script's ReadString leaves around what was
// typed, and it cannot join two commands: there is nothing on the far side of
// it. So the rule is embedded-only, and the trim happens first so that the
// check sees a line with its edges already removed.
//
// Quoting exists at all because config paths contain spaces. Without it an
// operator with a config under "My Documents" would find the console unable to
// express something the command line handles without being asked.
//
// An unterminated quote is refused rather than closed at end of line. Closing
// it would run a command the operator did not finish typing, and the one thing
// worse than refusing a destructive command is starting a different one.

// parse answers what a typed line means, without running it.
//
// Separate from starting a job on purpose. The console shows the operator what
// their line resolved to before anything runs, and the lines that answer
// themselves - version, help, an unknown command - are answered here without a
// job ever existing. It also means POST /api/v1/jobs keeps taking a Request and
// nothing else, so a script driving the API directly is unaffected by the
// console having a different input shape.
//
// Console defaults are applied to the parsed Request, so what comes back is
// what would run rather than what was typed. They include an explicit session
// default and the project-scoped state fallback used by bare /history and
// /status. Showing the operator anything else would be the status-bar mistake
// again: a display that is right until a default makes it wrong.
//
// POST /api/v1/jobs applies them again to whatever it is sent, which costs
// nothing: applyDefaults only fills fields that are empty, so a Request that
// already has them is unchanged. Applying here as well is what lets a console
// show the resolved paths before it starts anything, rather than after.
